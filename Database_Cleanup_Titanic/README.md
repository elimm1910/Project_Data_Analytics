Database preprocessing and cleaning are crucial steps in any data analysis project. These processes ensure that data is accurate, complete and consistent, which in turn improves the quality and reliability of analysis results. Data cleaning helps remove errors, duplicates, and null values, and preprocessing transforms data into a format suitable for analysis, such as normalizing values, handling outliers, and converting data types. By investing time in these early stages, you reduce the risks of obtaining incorrect or misleading results and ensure that decisions based on this data are informed and accurate.

For this process, Postgresql is used together with the Relational Database Management System pgAdmin 4.
