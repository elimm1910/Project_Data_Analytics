# Project_Data_Analytics
In this repository I will store and distribute the code that I use in each project related to data analysis.

* Cleaning Titanic database: Set up a structured table in pgAdmin 4 to efficiently handle data taken from the Titanic database coming from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sakshisatre/titanic-dataset), leveraging PostgreSQL for data cleansing and preprocessing.

* Super Store Sales Dashboard in Excel: A clear, visual representation of the sales data is provided in the table taken from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aditisaxena20/superstore-sales-dataset), using dynamic tables and graphs in Excel
