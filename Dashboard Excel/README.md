The Super Store Sales Dashboard not only provides a visual and clear representation of sales data but also facilitates a deep and detailed understanding of the various factors that affect store performance

### Super Store Sales Dashboard Creation Process
#### Data Copy and Preprocessing

Initially, a copy of the original table is made, saving it in a worksheet called "Working Sheet". This ensures that the data cleaning and preprocessing process can be carried out without the risk of losing critical information.

#### Data Verification and Cleaning

**Duplicates**: It is checked if there are duplicate values. In this case, they were not found.
Data Types: Ensures that data types are correct, paying special attention to date fields.
Null or Incorrect Values: It is checked that there are no null or incorrect values.
Discount Calculation: An additional column is added to calculate the exact discount values, since the existing column only provides the discount percentage.
Creation of Dynamic Tables and Graphs

**Dynamic Tables**: A section dedicated to dynamic tables is created where tables are designed for each relevant relationship that you wish to analyze. These tables allow data to be grouped and summarized efficiently.

**Dynamic Graphs**: From the dynamic tables, dynamic graphs are generated that represent the data in a coherent and representative way.
Super Store Sales Dashboard Structure

The dashboard is organized into several panels and sections, each focused on different aspects of sales analysis:

#### Sales and Profits Dashboard:
Analysis of the evolution of sales and profits over time.

#### Products and Shipping Panel:
Evaluation of the performance of different product categories and subcategories, as well as the comparison of shipping modes.

#### Geographic Panel:
View sales and shipping costs by region and state.

#### Analysis of Priorities and Discounts:
Study of the relationship between the priority of orders, the discounts applied and the impact on profits.
Interactive Filters

Interactive filters are implemented by year, category, segment and region. These filters allow you to analyze the data in a more specific and detailed way, facilitating a deep and precise understanding of trends and patterns in sales.
