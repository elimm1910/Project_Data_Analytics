## Dashboard in Tableu. Analysis of data
In this project we create a comprehensive view of rental property performance and trends taken from the 2016 AirBnB Database published on:
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle)

For the development of the project, Tableu is used, a powerful data visualization tool that allows you to create graphs, dashboards and interactive analyzes in an intuitive way. To prepare the data, Excel is used to join the three tables into to work in Tableu.

### AirBnB Dashboard

#### Revenu for Year
This graph shows the evolution of income throughout the year, allowing the identification of the periods of greatest demand for property rentals. Significant increases in income are observed during the months of March, June, and the last months of the year, which indicates greater demand in those periods.

#### Avg. price Per Bedroom
This graph shows how the increase in the price of the property depends on the number of bedrooms it has.

#### Price per night vs. Rating
This scatter plot compares nightly property prices with guest ratings. This helps identify the relationship between price and perceived quality

#### Property type
This graph shows the distribution of property types (apartments, houses, condominium, lofts, etc.) present in the inventory. It is observed how the rental of houses and apartments noticeably predominates.

#### Income by Property type
This graph shows the income generated by each type of property according to its number of rooms. This helps you understand what types of properties are most profitable. 

#### Price by Zipcode
This graph shows the income generated by properties in different regions. This allows you to identify the most profitable areas.

#### Distribution of properties
This map shows the distribution of Airbnb properties by geographic location. Colors are used to indicate the density of properties. The darker the color, the greater number of properties we can find in that location.
